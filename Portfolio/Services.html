        <h1 ><u>WEB DEVELOPMENT</u></h1>
         <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves a range of tasks and technologies to build and maintain websites that can be accessed through the internet. Web development encompasses both the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications, as well as other related tasks like web design, user experience (UX) design, and web content management.

            Here are the key components and aspects of web development:<ol>
            
            <li>Front-end Development: This involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. Front-end developers use technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual elements that users interact with in their web browsers. They also work on responsive design to ensure the site looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.</li>
            
            <li>Back-end Development: Back-end developers are responsible for the server-side of web applications. They work with server-side languages and frameworks like Python, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Node.js, and databases to handle data storage, application logic, and user authentication.</li>
            
            <li>Full-Stack Development: Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development. They can work on all aspects of a web application, from designing the user interface to building the server-side functionality.</li>
            
            <li>Web Design: While web development focuses on the technical aspects of building a website or web application, web design is concerned with the visual and aesthetic aspects. Web designers use tools like Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, or Figma to create the overall look and feel of a website, including layout, color schemes, and typography.</li>
